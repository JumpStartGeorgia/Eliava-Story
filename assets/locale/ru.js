    "text": "<p>When I saw the stacks of Soviet tools and machines on sale I thought to myself: ‘I’ve got to draw this place’.</p> <p>I had come to the Eliava market in Tbilisi as a customer, to buy some things for a home DIY job. But I found myself in a ‘Home Depot’ for the Soviet past, and the artist in me was fascinated.</p> <p>Buried inside an outer layer of shops selling new tools and construction materials was a sprawling labyrinth of stalls filled with Soviet-era engines, implements and spare parts. The rough-hewn shapes had a distinctive look that said ‘Made in the USSR’. And I decided to turn this mass of history into a drawing.</p> <p>I focused on one part of the market and set about creating a 360-degree panorama of everyone and everything in my field of view. And after nearly four months of work, always standing in the same place, it became a 4 metre-long ink drawing.</p> <p>I started with <a href='#' class='to-character' data-id='6'>Vazha Jamagidze</a> and the metal smorgasbord of Russian-made saws and spanners, and reconditioned bathroom taps he sells from two small benches. He has been working this space since the market first sprang up in the hard years after Georgia’s independence from the USSR in 1991. His solid arms and shoulders speak of another life before that, when he was a Soviet Army wrestling champion. And as I got to know him and the other stallholders, the journalist in me saw a wider story here.</p> <p>This is a free market selling the communist past - where some still wish it were the present. So it offers a unique window on Georgia’s transition and its often-tortured search for a new post-Soviet identity, pulled between west and east.</p> <p>Everyone in the drawing grew up in Soviet-run Georgia; and some have struggled to adjust to the fast-changing country that has replaced it. And whereas most Georgians now lean west and resent Moscow’s past and present intrusions, among the denizens of the Eliava, there is a more sympathetic attitude towards Russia and Soviet rule. It’s also more complex than that.</p> <p>Democracy and capitalism have brought only “anarchy and filth” complained Vazha, worrying that Georgia’s Christian-Orthodox traditions are under threat from “Western ideas” like LGBT rights. But other stallholders turned against Moscow precisely because of communist persecution of the Orthodox Church. Getting closer to the West - and getting into the European Union and NATO - they said, was now the only way to protect Georgia’s identity and sovereignty.</p> <p>At first I was the one answering questions about my background. What village am I from, several stallholders asked, a standard identity benchmark in Georgia. When I had to admit that I don’t have a village and that I’m from London, they seemed a little perplexed.</p> <p>The bigger challenge though was drawing each person in my 360-degree frame, working as quickly as I could before they moved, with the added pressure that they could see the result as soon as I had finished. That’s the paradox and the excitement of drawing. It is both slow and then very immediate.</p> <p>That also made it an attraction as the panorama took shape, with stallholders coming from other parts of the market to look and laugh, at how I had portrayed their friends. “It’s not bad,” smiled one visitor as he looked at my version of <a href='#' class='to-character' data-id='4'>Eduard</a>. “But you haven’t made his nose big enough.”</p> <p>Sometimes there were arguments, once even a fight. If I happened to be there on a key Orthodox holiday, like Mariamoba, or someone’s birthday, I could forget drawing. They took my pens away and gave me wine instead. <a href='#' class='to-character' data-id='10'>Tariel</a>, whose collection of muscular Russian motors I drew early on, locked away the drawing in his storeroom to make sure I didn’t keep working – and to keep it safe.</p> <p>Once their homemade wine started flowing though, I could barely walk in a straight line, let alone draw one. The Eliava is as much a culture and a community as a market.</p> <p>There was never going to be a future in recycling the past though. “This is not really a business,” <a href='#' class='to-character' data-id='7'>Mirian Nozadze</a> said to me ruefully, gesturing at the piles of chunky Soviet nuts and bolts that are his mainstay. “We are just speculators,” he added, using a derogatory communist-era term for business-people.</p> <p>Instead of a mid-way station to something better, the Eliava has become the end of the line for many working there - while the train turning Georgia into a market economy thunders on. It is a familiar test of wrenching change, and who bears most responsibility to deal with the consequences – the state or the individual.</p> <p>Marina, who has been selling snacks and cigarettes in the Eliava for nearly a decade, talked fondly of her childhood and her job in a Soviet garment factory. “I didn’t know what poverty was,” she said. But many people working in the Eliava are originally from Chiatura, a mining town in western Georgia that was hammered when its guaranteed Soviet market collapsed. I didn’t find any of them wanting the past back. “We have to cope with the new,” said <a href='#' class='to-character' data-id='11'>Taso</a>, even as she missed her old Chiatura home.</p> <p>The changes keep coming. Several stalls closed while I was working on the project and two people in the drawing have moved on.  So it is already a historical record.</p> <p>One day I went to see Gia Andriadze, who owns part of the Eliava’s land. We talked on the balcony of his penthouse office; atop a multi-storey retail complex he has built on space vacated by stallholders who have already given up. The future is mapped out below – new buildings pressing in on all sides of the drab tin roofs of the original market.</p> <p>Most of those stalls will be gone in five years, he predicts: “They are selling nostalgia.”</p>"
